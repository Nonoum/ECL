ZeroEater stream format.

1. Stream consists of independent blocks aligned by byte bound.

2. Each block starts with a "header" byte and optionally followed by a sequence of raw bytes.

3. Decompressor logic for each block (error conditions are not checked in this example):

header = read byte from stream
if (header & 0x80) == 0:
    count_x = (header & 0x7F) + 1
    copy count_x bytes from stream to output // stream pointer is adjusted
else if (header & 0x40) == 0:
    count_0 = (header & 0x3F) + 1
    add count_0 zero bytes to output
else:
    count_x = (header & 0x07) + 1
    count_0 = ((header >> 3) & 0x07) + 1
    copy count_x bytes from stream to output // stream pointer is adjusted
    add count_0 zero bytes to output

That's it.
