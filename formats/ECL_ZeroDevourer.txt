ZeroDevourer stream format.
Refers to functionality from:
- ECL_JH.txt
- ECL_E_number_format.txt

1. Stream consists of independent blocks aligned with JumpingHeader.

2. Decompressor logic for each block (error conditions are not checked in this example):

not_zero = read bit from JumpingHeader
if not_zero == 0:
    add zero byte to output stream
    continue to next block
else:
    opcode = read 2 bits from JumpingHeader
    if opcode == 0:
        count_x = read 2 bits from JumpingHeader
        count_x = count_x + 1
        count_0 = 1
    else if opcode == 1:
        count_x = read 4 bits from JumpingHeader
        count_x = count_x + 4
        count_0 = 1
    else if opcode == 2:
        count_x = 0
        count_0 = read E4 number from JumpingHeader
        count_0 = count_0 + 9
    else: // opcode == 3
        count_x = read E6E3 number from JumpingHeader
        count_0 = 0

    src_pointer = JumpingHeader.next
    JumpingHeader.jump(count_x)
    copy count_x bytes from src_pointer to output
    add count_0 zero bytes to output

That's it.
